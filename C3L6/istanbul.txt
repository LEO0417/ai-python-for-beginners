Istanbul Food Journal - Day 1

Merhaba from the magical city of Istanbul! Today I explored the incredible culinary crossroads where Europe meets Asia. Started my morning with a traditional Turkish breakfast - simit (Turkish bagel), beyaz peynir (white cheese), olives, tomatoes, and strong Turkish tea served in those beautiful tulip-shaped glasses.

For lunch, I wandered through the Grand Bazaar and discovered amazing street food. Döner kebab fresh from the rotating spit was incredibly flavorful, served with warm pide bread and fresh vegetables. I also tried börek, layers of phyllo pastry filled with cheese and herbs - absolutely delicious!

Dinner was a feast at a traditional meyhane. I enjoyed meze plates with hummus, baba ganoush, and stuffed grape leaves, followed by grilled sea bass from the Bosphorus. The baklava for dessert, dripping with honey and pistachios, was the perfect sweet ending.

Istanbul's food reflects its rich history as the heart of the Ottoman Empire. Every dish tells a story of cultural exchange, spice trade routes, and the beautiful fusion of flavors from both continents.

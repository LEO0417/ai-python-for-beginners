悉尼美食日记 - Sydney Food Journal

悉尼的美食体验令人难忘。在达令港的鱼市场品尝了新鲜的澳大利亚海鲜，包括悉尼岩牡蛎、塔斯马尼亚三文鱼和莫顿湾虾。午餐在邦迪海滩附近的一家现代澳大利亚餐厅享用了鳄鱼肉汉堡和袋鼠肉排。晚餐在悉尼塔旋转餐厅享用了精致的澳大利亚融合料理，包括柠檬香桃木烤羊排、澳洲坚果酱和帕夫洛娃蛋糕。澳大利亚的多元文化美食令人印象深刻。

The culinary experience in Sydney was unforgettable. At the fish market in Darling Harbour, I tasted fresh Australian seafood including Sydney rock oysters, Tasmanian salmon, and Moreton Bay bugs. For lunch at a modern Australian restaurant near Bondi Beach, I enjoyed crocodile burger and kangaroo steak. For dinner at the revolving restaurant in Sydney Tower, I savored refined Australian fusion cuisine including lemon myrtle roasted lamb, macadamia nut sauce, and pavlova cake. Australia's multicultural cuisine was impressive.

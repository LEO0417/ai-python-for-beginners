开普敦美食日记 - Cape Town Food Journal

今天在开普敦尝试了当地的海鲜美食。在V&A海滨市场品尝了新鲜的龙虾和贻贝，配以当地的白葡萄酒。晚餐在一家传统的南非餐厅享用了烤肉拼盘，包括羚羊肉、鸵鸟肉和牛肉，搭配传统的pap（玉米粥）和chakalaka（辣味蔬菜）。甜点尝试了malva pudding，一种温暖的焦糖布丁，非常美味。

Today in Cape Town, I tried the local seafood cuisine. At the V&A Waterfront market, I tasted fresh lobster and mussels paired with local white wine. For dinner at a traditional South African restaurant, I enjoyed a braai platter including springbok, ostrich, and beef, served with traditional pap (corn porridge) and chakalaka (spicy vegetables). For dessert, I tried malva pudding, a warm caramel pudding that was absolutely delicious.
